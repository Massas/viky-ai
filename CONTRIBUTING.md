## Reporting an Issue

viky.ai uses [GitHub Issue Tracking](https://github.com/viky-ai/core/issues) to track issues. If you've found a bug, this is the place to start. You'll need to create a GitHub account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them, or to create pull requests.

If you've found a problem in viky.ai do a search on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/viky-ai/core/issues) in case it has already been reported. If you are unable to find any open issues addressing the problem you found, your next step will be to [open a new one](https://github.com/viky-ai/core/issues/new).
