# Welcome to viky.ai


## What's viky.ai

viky.ai is a Natural Language Processing platform. It allows you to extract information from unstructured text contents.

The technical component `nlp` allows the extraction of structured information, this extraction is defined within agents. The agents are multilingual assistants to find relevant data. The "NLP" component takes as input a set of agents in JSON format and unstructured textual content in order to provide a JSON stream of structured data as output.

The second technical component `webapp` is a web application that allows you to work collaboratively to set up agents by offering dedicated interfaces. It also provides the interpret API in order to allow integration into a third-party system.
